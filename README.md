# flutter-portfolio

#### WORK IN PROGRESS
This application will be developed in iterations to showcase my flutter experience and progress.
In addition to these iterations, I am also working through Flutter tutorials and I will include them in this repo as I progress  

**Please checkout/review the feature branch: feature/about-me**

## Iteration 1 About (CURRENT):
Simple static app to demonstrate basic scaffold, layout, routing and tests.

During following iterations, this about page will be accessible but not a main feature.

## Iteration 2 Vegan Surprise/Slot Machine:
This feature will allow users to easily identify a vegan meal for dinner through playing a slot machine of available options and then resulting in string interpolated meal. I.e. which protein, spice blend, carb and vegetable selection.

This feature will incorporate database integration with Firebase; more advanced layout and tests.

## Iteration 3 Recipe Collection:
This feature will enable users to record recipes through a form.

Recipes will be stored in the database and will be displayed in a list including timestamp and star rating.
